Stuff anyone can do when they have time:
- spawn particle action
- spawn entity action
- set gamemode action with spectator mode
- drop item at coords action
- launch projectile action
- chat event
- tablist like hypixel's to see the owner of the house you are on

Bugs:
- sound next page don't work //Maybe fixed? //Didn't save either lol (done)
- placeholders wont display if there were more than two of them in one line (done)
- placeholders in messages limit (done)
  - to replicate, make a chat action with a placeholder like %stat.player/kills% followed by a bunch of characters
  - the characters will be cut off
- lines dupe in scoreboard (leave to alex)
- weird tick timing in execution (leave to alex)
- colors not working in title (done)
- setting times in title not working (done)
- change held item doesnt work (done)

Possible Ideas:
- scoreboard layouts
