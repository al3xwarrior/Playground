# üõù Playground *(Formerly Housing2)*
Originally created by Al3x with the idea of recreating Hypixel's gamemode Housing due to the fact at the time Housing went over 1 year without an update. The goal was to recreate the gamemode as if it were to constantly get new features and updates.

Now the project has a team of a few people who maintain the project as well as the public server you can join right now.
